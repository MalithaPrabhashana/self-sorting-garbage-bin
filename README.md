## Introduction
In todayâ€™s environmentally conscious world, efficient waste management solutions are critical. This project focuses on designing and implementing an innovative self-sorting garbage bin tailored for office environments. The bin autonomously categorizes and facilitates the disposal of diverse waste materials, fostering recycling practices and minimizing contamination.

## Project Overview
The self-sorting garbage bin system excels in sorting paper, polythene, and hard plastic, boasting a compact design for space efficiency and exceptional durability for long-lasting performance. This project streamlines waste disposal and raises awareness, encouraging responsible waste practices among office personnel.

## System Components
- **Sensors**: To identify different waste types.
- **Microcontrollers**: To control the sorting mechanism.
- **Actuators**: To direct waste to the appropriate bins.
- **Software**: Developed using MATLAB Simulink and SolidWorks.

## Design and Implementation
### SolidWorks Design
The parts of the dustbin were designed using SolidWorks. The design includes:
- **Main Bin Structure**: The primary framework of the self-sorting bin.
- **Sorting Mechanism**: Components responsible for waste segregation.

### MATLAB Simulink
Simulink models were used to simulate the behavior of the self-sorting bin. These models include:
- **Sensor Data Processing**: Interprets data from sensors to identify waste types.
- **Control Logic**: Manages the sorting mechanism based on sensor input.

### MATLAB Code
MATLAB scripts were developed to process sensor data and control the sorting mechanism. These scripts include:
- **Data Acquisition**: Collects data from sensors.
- **Sorting Algorithm**: Determines the appropriate bin for each waste type.

## Usage
To use the self-sorting garbage bin system:
1. **Design Setup**: Review the SolidWorks files and set up the bin structure.
2. **Simulation**: Use the Simulink models to simulate the system's behavior.
3. **Implementation**: Deploy the MATLAB scripts to control the sorting mechanism in a real-world setup.
